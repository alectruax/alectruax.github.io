## "Retail Electricity Pricing and Renewable Energy Generation in the United States"
**Abstract:** _While zero marginal cost renewable energy has reduced wholesale electricity prices, the effect on retail electricity prices is less clear. System costs from integrating intermittent renewable energy, such as transmission expansion, may offset or even exceed the reduction in wholesale generation costs. This paper provides causal estimates of the effect of renewable energy generation on retail electricity prices in the United States. To address the inherent simultaneity between prices and generation, I employ an instrumental variable strategy leveraging spatially-varying solar- and wind-potential derived capacity factors and time-varying levelized costs of wind and solar power. From 2004-2023, I find that a one percentage point increase in renewable generation share increases residential retail prices by 0.23\% (3.2\% at the 2023 mean), with no significant effects on industrial or commercial customers. These results suggest that the system costs of integration have roughly offset reduced generation costs, with a modest net impact on energy affordability for residential households._

## "The Depth of Trade: A Text-Based Approach"
**Abstract:** _This paper employs a hierarchical similarity analysis to develop a continuous, text-based measure of the depth of trade agreements, utilizing the legal texts of 448 WTO-ntified agreements from 1949 to 2016 in the Text of Trade Agreements database. This measure is compared to two widely used alternatives: the coverage ratio and the Design of Trade Agreements Index. Using a gravity model of international trade, I demonstrate that the proposed text-based measure produces different quantitative estimates of the effects of agreement depth on international trade flows compared to existing measures._

## "Sectoral Transport Mode Elasticities and International Trade" (with Jeong-won Ko and Sergey Nigai)
**Abstract:** _We estimate sector‐specific transport mode elasticities in international trade using newly available bilateral trade data disaggregated by mode and sector for 2016–2019. We rely on an instrumental variable approach that exploits the interaction of global, mode‐specific cost shocks with exogenous bilateral geography to identify elasticities for 21 manufacturing sectors. The estimates reveal substantial heterogeneity, ranging from statistically insignificant values near zero to 11.4, with high value‐to‐weight sectors such as pharmaceuticals and energy exhibiting greater sensitivity to mode costs than bulk and heavy goods sectors such as motor vehicles/parts and paper products. We embed these estimates in a multi‐country, multi‐sector general equilibrium trade model with endogenous mode choice and input–output linkages. In a counterfactual simulating observed global changes in air, sea, and road costs between 2010 and 2017, incorporating heterogeneous mode elasticities increases the cross‐country dispersion of welfare effects and changes the global mean effect relative to a uniform‐elasticity benchmark. The results underscore the importance of accounting for modal heterogeneity in empirical and quantitative trade analysis._
