I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the University of Colorado Boulder (expected Spring 2026). My research interests are energy, environmental, and natural resource economics, and international trade. My current work examines how intermittent renewable generation affects retail electricity prices, applies text-as-data methods to policy analysis, and studies how transport-mode choice shapes trade outcomes.
